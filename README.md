## Electrotactile feedback project

This is my masters project at the University of Glasgow. I am going to use an Functional Electric Stimulation machine, which has 4 electrodes connected to a person's shoulder. The nodes are -

- Left
- Right
- LeftFront
- RightFront

The nodes will be used for navigation, for example, if the left should buzzes, turn left. The goal is to design a pedestrian navigation system using electrotactile mode as haptic feedback. The code for the FES machine lies in [interface.py](./interface.py), and the library is [stim8updated.py](./stim8updated.py).
